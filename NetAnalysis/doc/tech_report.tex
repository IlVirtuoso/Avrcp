    \section{Brief description}
    A large social network of GitHub developers which was collected from the public API in June 2019. Nodes are developers who have starred at least 10 repositories and edges are mutual follower relationships between them.
    \subsection*{Context}
    GitHub is a double scope platform: In first place is used to store and develop software , either by open source developers and by companies, secondly is a social network for developers in which them can argue about technical solution and future projects. In GitHub a user can Fork ( copy the repository in his own userspace), view the code and star a repository. The star operation is a follow operation, thus a user can track the progress on certain repository.
